# [Experimental] Official Dockerfiles

Rework of TensorFlow's Dockerfiles

Maintainer: @angerson (TensorFlow, SIG Build)

TensorFlow's Official Dockerfiles (WIP). These document our officially supported

- Ease of maintenance is prioritized over image size.
- Whenever TensorFlow releases, `master` gets frozen into a new directory.
